# Overview
This was my first ever 3D modeling project I created using Blender. The idea was to create an educational clip for second grade students showcasing the transformation of a caterpillar to a butterfly. The final project blend file was too large to attach onto gitHub, so instead I attatched most of the used models along with the video clip.
